# (Not) Super Seducer: The Bootleg Version
(Couldn't think of a better name)

One of my first bigger projects, which is just a typical dating game *OMEGALUL*.

Expectedly, you start the game in **main.py**. The game's run through the terminal window. So, you're gonna see no graphics (unfortunately), just text.

## Story
Pressured by your family, you are desperate to find at least someone to date.
Thankfully, after numerous no-shows from your dating partners, one of your friends decide to give you a helping hand.
However, even after setting up the venue for your date, he refuses to give out more than a simple description about the person your're dating!

Apparently, it's to keep the whole occasion a "surprise."

By only knowing your date's personality, it seems that you'll just have to survive the events that unfold in a proper and gentlemanlike manner.

### Features
- 20 questions (so far) that each have 4 responses (4 * 20 = 80 unique responses)!
- 4 different personalities that your date can take on, each responding differently to how you act in certain questions!
- Maintain your confidence throughout the date by answering questions "correctly" and by using various items!
- Answer 15 randomly selected questions involving your date in order to win! Depending on how well you do can determine how your date thinks of you overall.
- Sweet gamer music!

# There are 2 ways to play/access this game

## 1. I just want to run the game

Want just the .exe of the game and its required files? Here: https://mega.nz/file/hkASFLCa#eolKQ-QGngVrbMcLFTCUO5i5SiNC0K5nyYI4UV5pEBc (Updated 12/31/2021)

Depending on your anti-virus software, the program may get labelled as a trojan. Of course, it's safe to assume that this is a false positive. Take a look at the source code and see for yourself if you don't believe me.

## 2. I want to see the source code of the game and also be able to play it

Requirements:
- Pygame
- Git LFS (I think, not too sure)

### idk how to make this game work pls help
For possible clueless users, like my future self, that may not understand how to actually get the game to work, here are some pointers that may help you out:

- You can't just straight up click the green download button and download the game as a zip. You have to actually clone the repository through the command line so that Git LFS can actually fetch its needed files.

- Make sure you're in the correct directory! I've personally wasted a couple of hours in dealing with this problem.

# Other Notes
- This game is a WIP (though I'm not planning to work on it any time soon). Things may be added, removed, etc. Who knows what'll happen?

- If you've played the game, you'll notice that some questions tend to repeat themselves across multiple playthroughs. This is because I only added 20 questions to the game. I ask you 15 of these questions (no repeats). So, for each completed playthrough you're going to cover 3/4 of my made questions. That's a lot! If you do have anymore questions, feel free to suggest them.
